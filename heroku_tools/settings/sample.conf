# ======================================================
# Heroku tool application configuration
#
# This is a sample configuration file showing how to set
# up a single Heroku application for deployments and
# configuration.
#
# Each application you want to deploy using the tool
# must have its own conf file - which will be
# referenced by its name - e.g. if you want to call
# your live application "live", then create a conf
# file called "live.conf".
#
# The `upstream` and `downstream` attributes are used to
# determine how to migrate data (downstream -> upsteam)
# and pipeline deployments (upstream -> downstream)
#
# ======================================================
application:

    # the name of the Heroku application
    name: live_app
    # the default branch to push to this application
    branch: master
    # use the heroku pipeline:promote feature
    pipeline: True
    # the upstream application to promote
    upstream: staging_app
    # if True, then tag the release using the Heroku release number
    add_tag: True
    # if True add a release note to the tag (experimental)
    add_rich_tag: True

    # Specify tasks to be run after deployment but before maintenance mode ends
    # These are basically shell commands, so must explicitly reference the
    # Heroku app with --app or -a as if on the CLI.

    post_deploy:
        - heroku run python manage.py migrate -a live_app --noinput
        # if you have a pipeline, with more than one app in a node
        # you will likely want to run commands for each app in that node
        - heroku run python manage.py migrate -a live_app_two_also_in_pipeline  --noinput
